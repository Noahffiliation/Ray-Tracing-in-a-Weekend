# Ray-Tracing-in-a-Weekend
Trying out ray tracing in C++ from Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend, found [here](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf)

The program writes out the pixels to `image.ppm` which can be uploaded [here](http://paulcuth.me.uk/netpbm-viewer/) to see the image

## Usage
```
$ g++ main.cc -o main

$ ./main
```

The program takes about 11 minutes to generate a complicated image.
